# Cyber-Attacks-Analysis
I analyzed a cybersecurity dataset using SQL and PostgreSQL to uncover key insights, and visualized the results using Power BI. This project demonstrates my ability to build a functional data pipeline and generate actionable intelligence from raw dataâ€”skills applicable to real-world scenarios.

Technologies Used: 
- SQL- Create tables, Create Views 
- Postgress SQL
- Power Bi

Skills Demonstrated:
- Data cleaning and organization
- Basic ETL system implementation 
- SQL: schema design and view creation
- Power BI: DAX formulas, drillthrough dashboards
- Data storytelling and visualization.

Key Insights
1. Top cyber attacks by country
2. Total financial loss per country
3. Financial loss breakdown by industry
4. Number of people affected per incident
5. Average time to resolve incidents
